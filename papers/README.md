# (S)AGE Research Papers

Research papers documenting the design, implementation, and empirical evaluation of the (S)AGE ((Sovereign) Agent Governed Experience) protocol.

## Papers

### Paper 1: Agent Memory Infrastructure
**Full Title:** Agent Memory Infrastructure: Byzantine-Resilient Institutional Memory for Multi-Agent Systems

Introduces (S)AGE — a Byzantine fault-tolerant institutional memory layer for multi-agent systems. Covers the architecture, Proof of Experience (PoE) consensus mechanism, CometBFT ABCI 2.0 integration, and the permissioned validator model. Includes performance benchmarks (956 req/s submissions, 21.6ms P95 queries) and BFT fault tolerance verification.

### Paper 2: Consensus-Validated Memory Improves Agent Performance
**Full Title:** Consensus-Validated Memory Improves Agent Performance on Complex Tasks

Presents empirical results from a controlled 50-vs-50 comparative study using the Level Up CTF platform. Demonstrates that consensus-validated institutional memory significantly improves agent performance on complex security challenge generation tasks, with statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney U, Cohen's d effect sizes).

### Paper 3: Institutional Memory as Organizational Knowledge
**Full Title:** Institutional Memory as Organizational Knowledge: AI Agents That Learn Their Jobs from Experience, Not Instructions

Frames (S)AGE through the lens of organizational knowledge management — agents that accumulate and share institutional knowledge through governed experience rather than prompt engineering. Explores the implications for multi-agent system design and sovereign AI infrastructure.

### Paper 4: Longitudinal Learning in Governed Multi-Agent Systems
**Full Title:** Longitudinal Learning in Governed Multi-Agent Systems: How Institutional Memory Improves Agent Performance Over Time

Presents a longitudinal study measuring whether consensus-validated institutional memory produces measurable, cumulative improvement in AI agent performance across sequential task executions. Using a 4-node BFT-backed memory layer and an 11-agent organization with 3-line prompts and zero domain expertise, conducts three experiments: a difficulty sweep, 10 sequential runs with red team feedback, and a 20-run control arm. Demonstrates statistically significant learning trends (Spearman rho=0.716, p=0.020) in the SAGE arm with no learning in the control (rho=0.040, p=0.901).
