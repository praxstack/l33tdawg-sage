"""(S)AGE SDK Example: RBAC Clearance Levels in Action.

Demonstrates how clearance levels work across organizations and
departments -- like security clearances in government agencies.

Scenario: A national cyber defense organization with three tiers:

  Organization: "National Cyber Command"
    |
    +-- Department: "Strategic Intelligence"  (clearance 4 = top secret)
    |     +-- Director (clearance 4, admin)
    |     +-- Senior Analyst (clearance 3, analyst)
    |
    +-- Department: "Tactical Operations"  (clearance 2 = operational)
    |     +-- Team Lead (clearance 3, lead)
    |     +-- Operator (clearance 2, member)
    |
    +-- Department: "Public Affairs"  (clearance 1 = public)
          +-- Spokesperson (clearance 1, member)

  Knowledge Domains:
    "classified_intel"    -- requires clearance >= 3 to write
    "operational_data"    -- requires clearance >= 2 to write
    "public_advisories"   -- requires clearance >= 1 to write

Each agent can only submit memories to domains their clearance
permits. The RBAC state is on-chain and auditable.

Usage:
    python examples/rbac_clearance.py

Set SAGE_URL to override the default endpoint (http://localhost:8080).

    # boundaries in your application layer or custom ABCI.
