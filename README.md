# SAGE — Give Your AI a Memory

Your AI forgets everything between conversations. SAGE fixes that.

SAGE is a persistent memory layer that runs on your laptop. Your AI remembers what you've worked on, what went wrong, what went right — across every conversation. Works with any AI — Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Mistral, local models, or anything that speaks MCP. No cloud accounts. No third-party access to your data. AES-256 encrypted at rest. Everything stays on your machine.

### Download

| **Linux** | [tar.gz](https://github.com/l33tdawg/sage/releases/latest) |

Double-click to install. The setup wizard opens in your browser — pick your AI, paste the config, done.

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from source (developers)</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/l33tdawg/sage.git
cd sage
go build -o sage-lite ./cmd/sage-lite/
./sage-lite setup    # Pick your AI, get MCP config
./sage-lite serve    # Start SAGE + Brain Dashboard
```
</details>

Or just paste this into any AI conversation:

> **Download and install SAGE from https://l33tdawg.github.io/sage/ — then take the red pill. Free your mind.**

Your AI will read the setup guide and configure itself. That's it.

## Why Not Just Use a "Memory Plugin"?

Those third-party MCP skills and plugins get full access to your conversations, your files, and your API keys. Some phone home. Some store your data on servers you've never heard of.

SAGE runs **entirely on your machine**. Your memories live in a SQLite file in your home directory, optionally encrypted with AES-256-GCM. Nothing leaves your laptop unless you explicitly configure a cloud embedding provider. No accounts, no telemetry, no surprises.

## What Your AI Gets

| Capability | What it means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Persistent memory** | Remembers across conversations — projects, preferences, past mistakes |
| **Governed knowledge** | Every memory goes through consensus validation, not just a flat file |
| **Confidence scoring** | Memories have confidence levels that strengthen with corroboration |
| **Natural decay** | Old, uncorroborated memories fade over time — like human memory |
| **Semantic search** | Your AI recalls relevant context, not just keyword matches |
| **Reflection loop** | Stores what worked AND what failed — both make it better |
| **Full audit trail** | Every memory is cryptographically signed (Ed25519) and traceable |
| **Encrypted at rest** | Optional AES-256-GCM encryption — if your laptop is stolen, memories are unreadable |
| **Dashboard auth** | Password-protected Brain Dashboard when encryption is enabled |
| **You own everything** | `~/.sage/data/sage.db` — standard SQLite, inspect or back up anytime |

## How It Works

Your AI gets 10 memory tools via MCP:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `sage_red_pill` | Wake up — initialize the AI's persistent memory |
| `sage_turn` | Per-turn memory cycle — recalls context AND stores what just happened |
| `sage_remember` | Store a memory (fact, observation, or inference) |
| `sage_recall` | Search memories by semantic similarity |
| `sage_reflect` | End-of-task reflection — what worked, what didn't |
| `sage_forget` | Mark a memory as deprecated |
| `sage_inception` | Alias for `sage_red_pill` |
| `sage_list` | Browse memories with filters |
| `sage_timeline` | View memories over time |
| `sage_status` | Check memory health and stats |

The AI uses these automatically. You just talk to it normally, and it builds institutional knowledge over time. `sage_turn` is called every conversation turn to keep memory flowing — the server enforces this with nudges and hard blocks if the AI forgets.

## Brain Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:8080/ui/` to see your AI's memory visualized as a living neural network. Memories appear as glowing nodes colored by domain, connections light up on recall, and everything updates in real-time via SSE. Includes search, timeline, memory export, and per-memory detail (content hash, confidence, provider, timestamps).

## The Research Behind It

SAGE isn't a weekend hack. It's backed by published research showing that governed memory makes AI agents measurably better over time.

| Paper | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| [Agent Memory Infrastructure](papers/Paper1%20-%20Agent%20Memory%20Infrastructure%20-%20Byzantine-Resilient%20Institutional%20Memory%20for%20Multi-Agent%20Systems.pdf) | Architecture for BFT-validated agent memory |
| [Consensus-Validated Memory](papers/Paper2%20-%20Consensus-Validated%20Memory%20Improves%20Agent%20Performance%20on%20Complex%20Tasks.pdf) | 50-vs-50 study: memory agents outperform memoryless ones |
| [Institutional Memory](papers/Paper3%20-%20Institutional%20Memory%20as%20Organizational%20Knowledge%20-%20AI%20Agents%20That%20Learn%20Their%20Jobs%20from%20Experience%20Not%20Instructions.pdf) | Agents that learn from experience, not just instructions |
| [Longitudinal Learning](papers/Paper4%20-%20Longitudinal%20Learning%20in%20Governed%20Multi-Agent%20Systems%20-%20How%20Institutional%20Memory%20Improves%20Agent%20Performance%20Over%20Time.pdf) | Cumulative learning across sessions (rho=0.716, p=0.020) |

## Embedding Providers

Privacy first. Your memories never leave your machine.

| Provider | Quality | Privacy | Cost | Setup |
|----------|---------|---------|------|-------|
| **Ollama** | Smart semantic search | Fully local | Free | Install Ollama |
| **Hash** | Keyword matching only | Fully local | Free | Nothing needed |

Start with hash (zero setup), upgrade to Ollama when you want semantic recall. Both run 100% locally.

## Scaling Up

SAGE Personal is a single-node version of a full BFT consensus protocol. When you're ready for teams and organizations:

- **Multi-validator deployment** — 4-node BFT cluster with CometBFT consensus
- **Python SDK** — programmatic agent integration
- **RBAC & Federation** — organizations, departments, clearance levels, cross-org knowledge sharing
- **Monitoring** — Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
- **956 req/s** throughput, **21.6ms P95** latency under load

See the **[Architecture & Deployment Guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** for the full multi-node setup.

---

## Security

SAGE has been through independent security review. Key hardening includes:

- **Ed25519 signed requests** — every API call is cryptographically signed with method + path + body + timestamp (prevents replay and cross-endpoint attacks)
- **AES-256-GCM encryption at rest** — optional full-database encryption with Argon2id key derivation
- **Transactional consistency** — all ABCI commit writes are wrapped in a single DB transaction (no partial writes on crash)
- **Request body limits** — `MaxBytesReader` on all endpoints to prevent memory exhaustion
- **Localhost-only binding** — personal node binds to 127.0.0.1 by default
- **Dashboard authentication** — session-based auth with HttpOnly/SameSite cookies when encryption is enabled

---

## Requirements

- **Go 1.24+** to build from source
- That's it. No Docker, no databases, no cloud accounts.
