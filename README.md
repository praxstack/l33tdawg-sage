# (S)AGE — Sovereign Agent Governed Experience

**Persistent, consensus-validated memory infrastructure for AI agents.**

SAGE gives AI agents institutional memory that persists across conversations, goes through BFT consensus validation, carries confidence scores, and decays naturally over time. Not a flat file. Not a vector DB bolted onto a chat app. Infrastructure — built on the same consensus primitives as distributed ledgers.

The architecture is described in [Paper 1: Agent Memory Infrastructure](papers/Paper1%20-%20Agent%20Memory%20Infrastructure%20-%20Byzantine-Resilient%20Institutional%20Memory%20for%20Multi-Agent%20Systems.pdf).

## Architecture

```
Agent (Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.)
  │ MCP / REST
  ▼
sage-gui
  ├── ABCI App (validation, confidence, decay, Ed25519 sigs)
  ├── App Validators (sentinel, dedup, quality, consistency — BFT 3/4 quorum)
  ├── Governance Engine (on-chain validator proposals + voting)
  ├── CometBFT consensus (single-validator or multi-agent network)
  ├── SQLite + optional AES-256-GCM encryption
  ├── CEREBRUM Dashboard (SPA, real-time SSE)
  └── Network Agent Manager (add/remove agents, key rotation, LAN pairing)
```

Personal mode runs a real CometBFT node with 4 in-process application validators — every memory write goes through pre-validation, signed vote transactions, and BFT quorum before committing. Same consensus pipeline as multi-node deployments. Add more agents from the dashboard when you're ready.

## CEREBRUM Dashboard

![CEREBRUM — Neural network memory visualization](docs/screen-brain.png)

`http://localhost:8080/ui/` — force-directed neural graph, domain filtering, semantic search, real-time updates via SSE.

### Network Management

![Network — Multi-agent management](docs/screen-network.png)

Add agents, configure domain-level read/write permissions, manage clearance levels, rotate keys, download bundles — all from the dashboard.

## What's New in v8.0

Access-control consensus cleanup. The three real bugs levelup surfaced on v7.1 — subdomain grants don't cascade, granting on an unowned domain fails, and a lost-owner domain has no recovery path — all land in a single consensus-rule fork gated behind the v7.5 upgrade machinery. Existing v7.1.x chains upgrade in place: the watchdog auto-proposes activation at `app-v2`, the fork takes effect at H+1, pre-fork blocks replay byte-identical to v7.1.1.

- **Ancestor-walk grants (`HasAccessOrAncestor`).** A grant on `pipeline.failures` now covers `pipeline.failures.pwn_buffer_overflow` and every descendant. Walks the dotted path leaf → root, first valid grant wins, 16-segment cap, shared domains (`general`, `self`, `meta`, `sage-*`) are barriers (NOT inheritable ancestors). `HasAccessMultiOrg`'s same-org clearance and federation paths inherit ancestor semantics via a new `ResolveOwningAncestor` resolver, so a domain whose ancestor is owned by org-X grants the same access as if the leaf itself were owned by org-X. Levelup's bootstrap script can stop registering every sub-domain by hand.
- **Auto-register on grant for unowned domains.** `processAccessGrant` now mirrors `processMemorySubmit`'s auto-register pattern: granting on an unowned non-shared domain makes the granter the owner atomically with the grant. Same-block races resolved by re-checking ownership after `ErrDomainAlreadyRegistered` (grants can't swallow the error the way submits do — if the granter lost the race, the second grant fails with Code 34 instead of writing for someone else's domain). Composes with the ancestor walk: a single grant on a parent both claims and propagates to all descendants. Shared domains explicitly reject with Code 50 — they're not ownable, ever.
- **Governance-gated domain reassign (`TxTypeDomainReassign`).** A new tx type, gated by a 3/4 supermajority gov proposal (typed exception to default 2/3), reassigns domain ownership and atomically clears all existing grants on the reassigned domain. The proposal carries a typed `Payload` (the same field SDK consumers see as `governance_propose(payload=...)`) so the on-chain proposal records exactly what the future DomainReassign tx will execute — body mismatch rejects with Code 83. Optional `open_to_shared=true` writes an on-chain `shared_domain:<name>` sentinel and the dynamic-shared-domain check goes hot — operators can promote a domain to the shared namespace without a code release.
- **REST surface.** New `POST /v1/domain/reassign` wraps the tx build + `broadcast_tx_commit` so FinalizeBlock rejections (Codes 80-87) surface as HTTP 403 with the upstream Log forwarded. `POST /v1/governance/propose` accepts an optional `payload` (base64-encoded bytes) for proposals that carry operation-specific data. Both documented in `api/openapi.yaml`.
- **Python SDK 8.0.0.** `client.submit_domain_reassign(domain, new_owner_id, proposal_id, parent_domain="", open_to_shared=False)` + `client.governance_propose(..., payload=dict | bytes | None)` on sync + async. Plus a high-level `client.reassign_domain(domain, new_owner_id, reason, ...)` end-to-end helper that proposes, polls until executed (or surfaces rejected/expired/cancelled as `SageAPIError`), and submits the reassign — single call to move ownership. `pip install sage-agent-sdk>=8.0.0`.
- **Observability.** New `sage_fork_branch_total{fork="v8",branch="pre|post"}` Prometheus counter, incremented inside each fork-gated handler so the cutover is visible live on dashboards: pre's rate rolls to zero, post starts counting, on the same block.
- **Fork-gate plumbing.** Shared across all three fixes — `SageApp.v8AppliedHeight` populated from the v7.5 audit trail (`BadgerStore.GetAppliedUpgrade("app-v2")`), `postV8Fork(height)` predicate for consensus handlers (strict `>` boundary mirrors CometBFT's H+1 semantic), `IsPostV8Fork()` accessor for REST handlers that don't carry a deterministic block height. Refreshed on `NewSageApp` boot and on `FinalizeBlock` activation. Pre-fork branches preserved byte-identical to v7.1.1; unit-test coverage on both branches for every fix.

## Older releases

<details>
<summary>Capability milestones across v3–v7 (full per-patch detail on the <a href="https://github.com/l33tdawg/sage/releases">Releases page</a>)</summary>

- **v7.7 — Agent profile fill-in.** `GET /v1/agent/me` now returns the full profile the OpenAPI schema promised — `display_name`, `domains`, `accuracy`, `on_chain_height` — so SDK consumers don't round-trip to `/v1/agent/{id}` plus the validator-score endpoint just to render a profile card.
- **v7.6 — Direct-write hooks for Claude Code and Codex.** `sage-gui hook session-start | session-end` signs REST calls to the local SAGE node directly; `mcp install` and `codex install` ship the unified 5-script lifecycle set; selfHeal migrates legacy installs and auto-installs hooks on MCP boot for pre-v7.6 projects (v7.6.2).
- **v7.5 — Migration substrate.** Hands-off in-place chain upgrades — scheduled snapshots with verify-by-restore, upgrade tx types with chain-computed activation height, auto-proposal watchdog, HALT sentinel + supervised rollback. v7.5.0 itself ships zero consensus-rule changes; it's the plumbing every later release rides on.
- **v7.1 — Recall quality + second benchmark.** Optional cross-encoder reranking and query expansion on `/v1/memory/hybrid`, LoCoMo benchmark (R@5=0.6394 stock), SAGE adapter shipped upstream to mem0's open-source evaluator. v7.1.1 closed the silent ghost-tx surface on RBAC/governance writes.
- **v7.0 — Hybrid recall + ambient capture.** BM25 + vector fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion on a new `/v1/memory/hybrid` endpoint, direct-write lifecycle hooks for Claude Code, branch-aware memory tagging, LongMemEval-S benchmark at R@5=0.9053.
- **v6.8 — Hardening pass.** OAuth Dynamic Client Registration + persistent client metadata, mandatory `state` + HMAC-signed CSRF on `/oauth/authorize`, strict same-origin on CEREBRUM wizard endpoints, locked-down subprocess test seams. Admin-bootstrap escape hatch (6.8.5), cross-agent visibility hotfix (6.8.4), Windows wizard parity (6.8.1).
- **v6.7 — ChatGPT MCP connector.** OAuth 2.0 + PKCE wrapper, RFC 8414/7591/9728 discovery and Dynamic Client Registration, in-dashboard ChatGPT setup wizard (6.7.3, Cloudflare zone dropdown 6.7.4), HTTPS-capable HTTP MCP transport (`/v1/mcp/sse` + `/v1/mcp/streamable` on `:8443`) with bearer tokens.
- **v6.6 — Tags + multi-org + RBAC fixes.** Tags first-class on `/v1/memory/submit` and `/query`/`/search` filtering. Multi-org membership reverse index so agents in N orgs no longer silently lose access to N-1 of them. `PUT /v1/agent/{id}/permission` no longer silent-no-ops for non-admin self/org-admin callers. SQLITE_BUSY silent-drop fix at source (WAL pragma + writeMu-guarded BeginTx). Encrypted CA key in quorum manifest (Argon2id + AES-256-GCM envelope).
- **v6.5 — TLS everywhere.** Per-quorum ECDSA P-256 CA, dual-listener REST API (TLS `:8443` + local HTTP `:8080`), Python SDK `ca_cert` parameter. Stuck-proposed deprecation when quorum unreachable. RBAC ownership-theft fix + real broadcast errors surfaced to clients.
- **v6.0 — Dynamic validator governance.** Add/remove/repower validators without stopping the chain via on-chain governance proposals (2/3 BFT quorum). New `internal/governance/` package, in-dashboard Governance section.
- **v5.x — Consensus-first writes + FTS5.** All submissions go through BFT consensus before they surface in queries. 4-validator Docker cluster with fault injection in CI. FTS5 keyword search fallback. Nonce-based replay protection. Python SDK.
- **v4.x — App validators + RBAC + Synaptic Ledger.** Sentinel / Dedup / Quality / Consistency validators with 3/4 quorum. Agent isolation, domain-level permissions, clearance levels, multi-org federation. AES-256-GCM encryption with Argon2id key derivation.
- **v3.x — Multi-agent networks.** Add agents from dashboard, LAN pairing, key rotation, redeployment orchestrator. On-chain agent identity via CometBFT consensus. CEREBRUM dashboard.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/l33tdawg/sage.git && cd sage
go build -o sage-gui ./cmd/sage-gui/
./sage-gui setup    # Pick your AI, get MCP config
./sage-gui serve    # SAGE + Dashboard on :8080
```

Or grab a binary: [macOS DMG](https://github.com/l33tdawg/sage/releases/latest) (signed & notarized) | [Windows EXE](https://github.com/l33tdawg/sage/releases/latest) | [Linux tar.gz](https://github.com/l33tdawg/sage/releases/latest)

### Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/l33tdawg/sage:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ~/.sage:/root/.sage ghcr.io/l33tdawg/sage:latest
```

Pin a specific version with `ghcr.io/l33tdawg/sage:6.0.0`.

### Upgrading from an older version?

If you installed SAGE before v5.0 and your AI isn't doing turn-by-turn memory updates, re-run the installer in your project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
sage-gui mcp install
```

This installs Claude Code hooks that enforce the memory lifecycle (boot, turn, reflect) — even if your `.mcp.json` is already configured. Restart your Claude Code session after running this.
