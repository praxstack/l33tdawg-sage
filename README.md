# (S)AGE — Sovereign Agent Governed Experience

**Persistent, consensus-validated memory infrastructure for AI agents.**

SAGE gives AI agents institutional memory that persists across conversations, goes through BFT consensus validation, carries confidence scores, and decays naturally over time. Not a flat file. Not a vector DB bolted onto a chat app. Infrastructure — built on the same consensus primitives as distributed ledgers.

The architecture is described in [Paper 1: Agent Memory Infrastructure](papers/Paper1%20-%20Agent%20Memory%20Infrastructure%20-%20Byzantine-Resilient%20Institutional%20Memory%20for%20Multi-Agent%20Systems.pdf).

## What's New in v6.7

- **ChatGPT MCP connector — DCR, discovery, consent UX (6.7.5)** —
  - Adds Dynamic Client Registration (`POST /oauth/register`, RFC 7591) and Protected Resource Metadata (`GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, RFC 9728). Bearer middleware emits `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="sage", resource_metadata=…` on 401s from `/v1/mcp/*` so MCP clients can bootstrap the OAuth flow from a 401. Discovery doc now advertises `registration_endpoint`. CORS preflight handlers for every OAuth route.
  - Consent screen now lists the operator's active agents in a dropdown (admins first, default-selected) — first-time setup is Connect → Continue → Authorize → done. Falls back to the text input on fresh-install nodes with no active agents.
  - SPA honors `?next=` for already-authed users so the OAuth wizard hop lands directly on the consent screen instead of the dashboard. Same-origin path validation only.
  - Static assets under `/ui/*` ship with `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` and a build-version query string on script + stylesheet URLs, so SPA updates reach users immediately.
  - Trace logging at `/oauth/token` for operator-side diagnostics — one log line per redemption attempt with method, remote, UA, redirect_uri, client_id, and outcome.
  - **Operator note:** Cloudflare Bot Fight Mode (free-tier) blocks server-to-server OAuth callbacks from OpenAI's backend with a Managed Challenge. Disable Bot Fight Mode for the SAGE host before connecting ChatGPT (Cloudflare → zone → Security → Bots → toggle off). Paid-tier Super Bot Fight Mode is skippable via a custom rule covering `/oauth/*`, `/.well-known/oauth-*`, `/v1/mcp/*`.

- **Cloudflare zone dropdown in the ChatGPT wizard (6.7.4)** — v6.7.3 shipped the wizard but Step 4 ("pick your hostname") asked the user to TYPE in the domain name from their Cloudflare account, with a regex-validated free-text input. Friction surface for typos, no autocomplete, no confirmation that the domain actually exists on the user's account. Fix: `web/wizard_chatgpt.go:listCloudflareZones` now decodes the base64-JSON token embedded in `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem` (`{zoneID, accountID, apiToken}`) and pages `GET https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones?status=active` with the apiToken to enumerate the user's active zones. Returned to the frontend via the existing `/v1/wizard/chatgpt/login-status` endpoint as `zones: [{id, name}]`. The frontend renders a `<select>` populated from that list when present, falls back to the free-text input otherwise. Pure stdlib — no new HTTP client dependency. The previous v6.7.3 scope-cut comment in the code is replaced with the real implementation. Single-zone accounts now auto-select the only option (saves a click). On API failure (token revoked, network down) the wizard degrades gracefully to the manual-entry input.

- **CEREBRUM ChatGPT setup wizard (6.7.3)** — ChatGPT setup is now a 6-click wizard. The cryptographic trust model from v6.7.2 is unchanged; what changes is the UX. Where v6.7.2 required nine manual terminal commands to wire SAGE up to ChatGPT's MCP connector (`cloudflared tunnel login` → `cloudflared tunnel create sage` → pick a domain you own → `cloudflared tunnel route dns ...` → hand-edit `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` with the right path-allowlist regex → wire up launchd/systemd → mint a bearer → copy seven fields into ChatGPT's New App form), v6.7.3 collapses the whole thing into a guided flow inside the Network tab.

  The wizard sits next to the existing agent management UI under a new "Connect external clients" section with two cards: "Connect to ChatGPT" (full guided wizard) and "Connect to Cursor / Cline / Claude Desktop" (informational — those clients accept bearer-only and don't need a tunnel, which is more local-first; the panel mints a bearer and shows the exact JSON block to paste into the client's MCP config).

  The ChatGPT wizard walks the user through 7 screens: (1) philosophy + prerequisites — explains explicitly that SAGE is local-first and never proxies through anyone's cloud, and tells users without a domain to pick the bearer-only card instead; (2) `cloudflared` install check via `exec.LookPath`, with one-click `brew install cloudflared` (macOS) or `curl`-the-static-binary-into-`~/.local/bin` (linux), streaming stdout/stderr to the UI; (3) `cloudflared tunnel login` — captures the URL cloudflared prints, fires `open`/`xdg-open` to launch the user's browser, then polls `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem` filesystem-side for completion; (4) hostname picker (subdomain + zone with strict RFC-1035 client-side and server-side validation); (5) tunnel orchestration — `cloudflared tunnel create sage`, `cloudflared tunnel route dns sage <hostname>`, generate `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` with the same path-allowlisted ingress regex from the v6.7.2 README (`/v1/mcp/(sse|messages|streamable)`, `/oauth/(authorize|token|register)`, `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/health`, default 404), install `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cloudflared.sage.plist` (macOS) or `~/.config/systemd/user/cloudflared-sage.service` (linux) with `KeepAlive=true` / `Restart=always`, then poll `https://<host>/health` for 200 to verify reachability — every step streams progress to the wizard via chunked text/plain; (6) agent picker + token mint, wrapping the existing `/v1/mcp/tokens` flow with simpler ergonomics; (7) the "paste into ChatGPT" card with one-click copy buttons for every field in ChatGPT's connector form, including the bearer (shown ONCE with a Show/Hide toggle), and a deep-link to `chatgpt.com/#settings/Connectors`.

  Six new admin-auth-gated endpoints under `/v1/wizard/chatgpt/`: `POST /check-cloudflared` returns `{installed, version}`; `POST /install-cloudflared` runs the platform install and streams a chunked text response of `out:` / `err:` / `done:<exitcode>` lines; `POST /login` starts `cloudflared tunnel login` as a background subprocess, captures the URL via stdout regex within a 10s deadline, fires the browser open call, and returns `{url, started}`; `GET /login-status` checks for `cert.pem` and returns `{authenticated, cert_path?, cert_size?, cert_modified?, zones}`; `POST /create-tunnel` accepts `{subdomain, zone}`, validates them strictly with RFC-1035 / dotted-hostname allowlists (any subprocess input that fails validation returns 400 before any `exec.Command`), and streams `step: msg\n` progress lines (e.g. `tunnel: uuid=...`, `dns: ...`, `config: wrote ...`, `autostart: launchctl loaded com.cloudflared.sage`, `verify: tunnel is up`, terminal `done: <exitcode>`); `POST /mint-token` accepts `{agent_id, token_name}` and proxies to the existing token issuance primitive (32-byte base64url plaintext + persisted SHA-256 digest, single-shot reveal — same row format as `sage-gui mcp-token create` so the wizard-minted bearer is fully visible to `mcp-token list` and revocable from anywhere).

  **Boundaries we deliberately did NOT cross.** No SAGE-hosted relay, no "phone home" feature, no managed service — the wizard is purely local-first orchestration. v6.7.2's OAuth wrapper code is unchanged. Pre-existing user state is protected: if `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` already references a different tunnel, the wizard refuses to overwrite it and returns the path so the user can inspect manually. If a tunnel named `sage` already exists in `cloudflared tunnel list`, the wizard reuses it instead of creating a duplicate. All subprocess inputs are strictly validated before invocation: subdomains must match `^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?$`, zones must match a dotted-hostname pattern, tunnel UUIDs must match the canonical 8-4-4-4-12 lowercase hex format. The `SAGE_CLOUDFLARED_BIN` env var lets tests inject a fake cloudflared binary without touching `$PATH`; `SAGE_BROWSER_OPEN_BIN` does the same for the browser launcher.

  Files: new `web/wizard_chatgpt.go` (six handlers + helpers + config.yml/launchd/systemd templates + 30s health-probe verifier), new `web/wizard_chatgpt_token.go` (token-mint primitive that mirrors `api/rest/mcp_tokens_handler.go` so wizard-minted bearers are byte-identical to CLI-minted ones), new `web/wizard_chatgpt_test.go` (mocked subprocess via fake-cloudflared shell script + filesystem fixtures + happy-path E2E that threads check → login → loginStatus → createTunnel → mintToken). New frontend: `web/static/js/api.js` adds 6 wizard API helpers; `web/static/js/app.js` adds the `ChatGPTSetupWizard` and `CursorSetupPanel` Preact components (~310 LOC) plus a "Connect external clients" section in `NetworkPage` between the governance panel and the agent list; `web/static/css/sage.css` adds `.ext-clients-section` / `.ext-client-card` styling. `web/handler.go` calls `h.RegisterChatGPTWizardRoutes(r)` from the existing auth-protected route group, so the wizard inherits the same passphrase-unlock UX as the rest of CEREBRUM. SDK: Python version bump to 6.7.3 (no API changes — wizard is a CEREBRUM-only feature).

- **OAuth 2.0 + PKCE wrapper for ChatGPT MCP connector compat (6.7.2)** — ChatGPT's MCP connector now works against SAGE. Cursor/Cline/Claude Desktop have always accepted the bearer-token scheme shipped in v6.7.0/v6.7.1, but ChatGPT's connector form requires `Authorization URL` + `Token URL` and explicitly rejects "static bearer in Client ID" (the form's red banner says: *"Enter both Auth URL and Token URL to continue with manual OAuth settings"*). v6.7.2 adds a thin OAuth 2.0 + PKCE layer in front of the existing bearer-token transport so that ChatGPT — and any other connector that demands a standards-track OAuth flow — can authenticate against SAGE without touching the v6.7.1 bearer scheme.

  Three new endpoints, mounted at the host root (NOT under `/v1/mcp/`):
  - `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` — RFC 8414 Authorization Server Metadata. Returns `issuer`, `authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`, `response_types_supported: ["code"]`, `grant_types_supported: ["authorization_code"]`, `code_challenge_methods_supported: ["S256"]`, `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported: ["none"]`. ChatGPT's connector auto-discovers this from the MCP server URL's host, so you usually don't need to fill in the URL fields manually. We do NOT advertise `registration_endpoint` — Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) is not implemented in v6.7.2; ChatGPT's "User-Defined OAuth Client" mode handles that fine.
  - `GET/POST /oauth/authorize` — the consent screen. Validates `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `state`, `code_challenge` (S256 only), `response_type=code` per RFC 6749 §4.1.1. The screen is gated behind the existing dashboard session cookie when encryption is on (`DashboardHandler.IsRequestAuthenticated` — same passphrase-unlock UX as the rest of CEREBRUM); on submit, SAGE mints a fresh `mcp_tokens` row, generates a 32-byte base64url authorization code, binds them in `mcp_auth_codes`, and 302-redirects back to the client's `redirect_uri` with `?code=...&state=...`.
  - `POST /oauth/token` — code-for-bearer exchange. Form-encoded body per OAuth: `grant_type=authorization_code&code=...&redirect_uri=...&code_verifier=...&client_id=...`. SAGE atomically marks the code used (single-use enforced via `UPDATE...WHERE used_at IS NULL`), verifies SHA-256(verifier) matches the stored challenge in constant time, and returns `{"access_token": "<bearer>", "token_type": "Bearer", "expires_in": 0}`. `expires_in=0` means "doesn't expire" — the underlying `mcp_tokens` revocation status is the real lifetime gate, and the OAuth spec doesn't require non-zero. The bearer the OAuth flow yields is a normal `mcp_tokens` row, fully visible to `sage-gui mcp-token list` and revocable from the dashboard or `sage-gui mcp-token revoke <id>`.

  Auth-code TTL is 5 minutes and single-use is enforced. Codes live in a new `mcp_auth_codes` table next to `mcp_tokens`, with the bearer plaintext attached for the brief window between `/authorize` and `/token` (wiped by the same UPDATE that marks the code used). `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` for the PKCE verifier check; no early-return timing leak.

  **ChatGPT setup walkthrough.** Open ChatGPT → New App / Connector → MCP Server, then:
  1. **MCP Server URL:** `https://<host>:8443/v1/mcp/sse`
  2. **Authentication:** OAuth → Advanced settings.
  3. **Auth URL:** `https://<host>:8443/oauth/authorize` (or leave blank — ChatGPT auto-discovers from `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`).
  4. **Token URL:** `https://<host>:8443/oauth/token` (same — discovery covers it).
  5. **OAuth Client ID:** any string. We don't validate it; ChatGPT just requires the field. Suggest `chatgpt`.
  6. **OAuth Client Secret:** leave empty.
  7. **Token endpoint auth method:** `none` (matches `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`).
  8. Click Create. ChatGPT redirects you to `/oauth/authorize` → you paste the agent ID for the bearer this connection should run as → SAGE redirects back to ChatGPT with a code → ChatGPT exchanges the code for the bearer → MCP session live.

  Bearer-only clients (Cursor, Cline, Claude Desktop, custom HTTP MCP clients) keep using `sage-gui mcp-token create` + `Authorization: Bearer <token>` exactly like v6.7.1 — the OAuth wrapper is purely additive. Self-signed cert note from v6.7.0 still applies: ChatGPT cannot reach `localhost`, so use a tunnel (cloudflared/ngrok) or a publicly-trusted reverse proxy.

  Files: new `api/rest/oauth_handlers.go` (discovery doc, `/authorize`, `/token`, in-process consent template, RFC 6749 §5.2 error envelope), new `internal/store/mcp_auth_codes.go` (`mcp_auth_codes` table, `IssueAuthCode`/`RedeemAuthCode`/`PurgeExpiredAuthCodes`, PKCE S256 verify, single-use enforcement). Tests: `api/rest/oauth_handlers_test.go` (discovery shape, missing-params 400, unauthed 302 redirect, GET renders consent, POST mints code + redirects, full happy-path token exchange, code reuse 400, bad verifier 400, redirect mismatch 400, bad grant_type 400, missing fields 400, GET /token 405) and `internal/store/mcp_auth_codes_test.go` (issue/redeem happy, single-use, PKCE mismatch, redirect mismatch, expiry, not-found, unsupported method, required-field validation, purge, bearer-wiped-after-redeem). Wired in `cmd/sage-gui/node.go` after the dashboard mount; `web/handler.go` exports `IsRequestAuthenticated` so OAuth reuses the existing session cookie. Bearer middleware on `/v1/mcp/sse`/`/v1/mcp/streamable` is unchanged. SDK: Python version bump to 6.7.2 (no API changes — OAuth is for external clients, the Python SDK uses ed25519 signed REST).
- **`/v1/mcp/tokens` route-shadow hotfix (6.7.1)** — v6.7.0 silently broke every caller of `POST/GET/DELETE /v1/mcp/tokens`, including `sage-gui mcp-token create` and any future dashboard UI. Root cause: `cmd/sage-gui/node.go` mounted the SSE/streamable transport via `r.Route("/v1/mcp", …)`, which chi resolves as a catchall subrouter at `/v1/mcp/*` — shadowing the `/v1/mcp/tokens` registration that the api/rest router added under ed25519 admin auth. Every token-management call returned HTTP 404 with CORS headers (the request reached the mux but no route matched). Fix: register the transport endpoints as flat `r.With(CORS, Bearer).Get/Post(...)` so the parent router's route tree keeps `/v1/mcp/tokens` reachable. Bearer middleware still applies only to the SSE/streamable routes; ed25519 admin auth still gates token management. Caught when minting the first ChatGPT bearer token via `sage-gui mcp-token create` against the v6.7.0 binary. Anyone on v6.7.0 should upgrade — the new HTTP MCP transport itself works on v6.7.0, but you can't issue tokens to use it.
- **HTTPS-capable HTTP MCP transport (6.7.0)** — SAGE is now addressable as an HTTP/HTTPS MCP server in addition to the existing stdio transport. Non-Claude-Code agents — ChatGPT, Cursor, Cline, and any custom HTTP MCP client — can now connect to SAGE without spawning `sage-gui mcp` as a subprocess. Three new endpoints under `/v1/mcp`:
  - `GET /v1/mcp/sse` — Server-Sent Events transport (older MCP spec, currently used by ChatGPT's connector). Persistent stream from server → client; pair with `POST /v1/mcp/messages?sessionId=…` for client → server JSON-RPC requests.
  - `POST /v1/mcp/streamable` — newer Streamable-HTTP single-endpoint transport for MCP clients that prefer one round-trip per call.
  - The same hand-rolled JSON-RPC dispatcher (`Server.DispatchJSONRPC`) handles BOTH the existing stdio path AND the new HTTP transports — no third-party MCP library, no duplicate tool routing. Tool registry in `internal/mcp/tools.go` is unchanged.

  TLS is on by default — `:8443` already serves the chi router, so the HTTP MCP endpoints inherit HTTPS automatically. Plain `:8080` is also live for local development. ChatGPT's MCP connector requires HTTPS, so the public-facing entry point is `https://<host>:8443/v1/mcp/sse`.

  **Bearer-token auth.** External MCP clients can't easily ed25519-sign every request, so we added a simple bearer-token path: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Tokens are 32 random bytes, base64url-encoded; we store the SHA-256 digest only, so a DB compromise can't leak working credentials. Token issuance/revocation is admin-managed via the existing ed25519-signed REST API at `POST /v1/mcp/tokens`, `GET /v1/mcp/tokens`, `DELETE /v1/mcp/tokens/{id}`. CLI parity: `sage-gui mcp-token create --agent <id> --name <label>`, `sage-gui mcp-token list`, `sage-gui mcp-token revoke <id>`.

  **CORS.** `/v1/mcp/*` reflects the request `Origin` (or wildcards if absent), allows the bearer-relevant headers (`Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `Mcp-Session-Id`), and answers preflight. MCP clients are first-class — same-origin paranoia doesn't apply to local development tools.

  **ChatGPT setup walkthrough.** Open ChatGPT → Settings → Connectors → Create New → MCP Server. Set:
  1. **Name:** SAGE (or whatever)
  2. **MCP Server URL:** `https://<your-host>:8443/v1/mcp/sse`
  3. **Authentication:** Custom (Bearer Token)
  4. **Token:** paste the value from `sage-gui mcp-token create --agent <your-agent-id> --name chatgpt`

  Self-signed cert note: SAGE auto-generates its own CA at `~/.sage/certs/` on first boot. ChatGPT's connector currently rejects self-signed certs, so for local-only setups you'll need to either (a) tunnel via cloudflared/ngrok and let the tunnel terminate TLS with a publicly-trusted cert, or (b) put SAGE behind a reverse proxy that uses a Let's Encrypt cert. ChatGPT cannot reach `localhost` either way — the tunnel/proxy is required for any cloud-hosted MCP client.

  Files: new `internal/mcp/http_transport.go` (SSE + Streamable transports + CORS middleware), new `api/rest/mcp_tokens_handler.go` (admin issue/list/revoke), new `api/rest/middleware/bearer.go` (bearer auth), new `internal/store/mcp_tokens.go` (SHA-256 digest store + `mcp_tokens` table). Tests: `internal/mcp/http_transport_test.go`, `api/rest/middleware/bearer_test.go`, `api/rest/mcp_tokens_handler_test.go`, `internal/store/mcp_tokens_test.go`. Stdio MCP path is untouched — Claude Code spawning `sage-gui mcp` still works exactly as before.

## What's New in v6.6

- **Tags on propose + tag-filtered semantic recall (6.6.0)** — `POST /v1/memory/submit` now accepts `tags`, and `/v1/memory/query` and `/search` accept a `tags` filter (any-match / OR semantics). MCP `toolRemember` drops the old 2-step tag dance — single atomic submit. Python SDK: `propose(tags=...)` and `query(tags=...)`.
- **Offchain SQLITE_BUSY silent-drop fix (6.6.1)** — Under sustained SQLite lock contention, the offchain `Commit()` flush could exhaust its retry budget, log CRITICAL, and silently clear pending writes while BadgerDB had already advanced — CometBFT then skipped replay on restart and the writes were lost invisibly. Now: flush runs *before* BadgerDB state is saved, retry budget raised to 30 attempts, panic on exhaustion so CometBFT replays the block. First surfaced by Level Up: 521 accepted submits with zero new visible memories across 96 hours on 6.5.5.
- **Silent-filter observability (6.6.2)** — `/v1/memory/list`, `/query`, `/search` now set an `X-SAGE-Filter-Applied` header and a `filtered` JSON envelope whenever either silent-hide filter ran. `/list` includes `total_before_filter` + `visible` counts; `/query`/`/search` include `hidden_count`. Empty-domain vs RBAC-filtered is finally distinguishable.
- **Org-clearance-as-seeAll (6.6.2)** — TopSecret (clearance=4) org members bypass the `submitting_agents` RBAC filter automatically. Per-domain access control and per-record classification gates still apply. Closes the `visible_agents="*"` boilerplate for single-org deployments.
- **Admin bootstrap playbook (6.6.2)** — New `docs/ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP.md` documents three deployment patterns (single-org, multi-org federated, homogeneous-trust legacy) with setup commands and the chain-reset visibility gotcha.
- **ABCI healthcheck + chain-bootstrap-window doc (6.6.3)** — `deploy/Dockerfile.abci` ships a HEALTHCHECK with `start_period=5m` to cover the ~3min CometBFT cold-start window on fresh data dirs, so Docker doesn't false-flag containers as unhealthy during normal bootstrap. Doc adds the 503-vs-connection-refused diagnostic and orchestrator guidance for Kubernetes `startupProbe`.
- **Root-cause SQLite pragma fix, tx serialization, post-commit context (6.6.4)** — Three cascading bugs surfaced by concurrent propose-with-tags workloads: (1) the `_journal_mode=WAL` DSN form is silently dropped by `modernc.org/sqlite` — the DB has been running in rollback-journal mode with `busy_timeout=0` since the driver switch, which is the root cause behind the 6.6.1 symptom (now fixed at source with `_pragma=journal_mode(WAL)` and explicit follow-up PRAGMAs as belt-and-braces); (2) `SetTags` + 5 other store methods opened transactions with raw `s.db.BeginTx`, bypassing the writeMu that writeExecContext/RunInTx use to serialize writes — fixed via a new `beginTxLocked` helper; (3) post-commit `SetTags` and `UpdateAgentLastSeen` ran on `r.Context()`, so a client disconnect (SIGKILL, timeout) between `broadcastTxCommit` returning and the tag write left untagged orphan rows that broke tag-based idempotency — now run under a 10s background context. Also: `POST /v1/agent/register` first-time registration now surfaces `on_chain_height` (previously only returned on the idempotent `already_registered` path, which SDK callers read as a version-drift signal). First surfaced by RAPTOR's `libexec/raptor-sage-setup` — concurrent `asyncio.gather(Semaphore(8))` proposes produced 396 SQLITE_BUSY + 197 tag-write failures on 6.6.3, zero after the fix.
- **`sage_recall` no longer surfaces a cryptic FTS5 error on vault-encrypted nodes (6.6.10)** — On a node with the synaptic-ledger vault unlocked, memory content is AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest, so SQLite FTS5 cannot text-index it. `internal/store/sqlite.go:SearchByText` correctly bails with a hard error in that case — but `internal/mcp/tools.go:toolRecall` was routing to that very FTS5 path (`POST /v1/memory/search`) whenever `isSemanticMode(ctx)` returned false. `isSemanticMode` decides from `/v1/embed/info`'s `semantic` field, which `api/rest/embed_handler.go:handleEmbedInfo` derived purely from `embedder.Semantic()` — vault-state was nowhere in the decision. Result: any vault-active node without an Ollama embedder configured silently degraded every `sage_recall` call into the literal error string `"text search unavailable: content is encrypted — use semantic search with Ollama"` bubbled verbatim through MCP to the agent, which has no `sage_recall` knob to "switch to semantic" — they just called the tool and got an error they couldn't act on. Multiple agents on the SAGE network hit this for weeks before Dhillon caught it on a freshly-registered claude-code agent. Fix is two-layered: (1) `handleEmbedInfo` now type-asserts the store to `vaultStatusReporter` (new `SQLiteStore.VaultActive()` method) and forces `semantic=true` whenever the vault is active — even if no embedder is configured, so the embed call fails with a clearer downstream error rather than the cryptic FTS5 path; (2) belt-and-braces in `toolRecall`: if the FTS5 path's `doSignedJSON` returns an error containing the marker `"text search unavailable: content is vault-encrypted"`, the handler logs a warning, warms the `semanticMode` cache to `true`, and retries via the new shared `recallSemantic` helper — so older nodes that haven't been upgraded still recover gracefully. The marker constant lives at `internal/mcp/tools.go:vaultEncryptedSearchMarker` paired with `internal/store/sqlite.go:ErrTextSearchVaultEncryptedMsg` (the canonical wording — `"text search unavailable: content is vault-encrypted; this node is in semantic-only mode"` — replaces the old "use Ollama" message that was misleading because there's nothing the caller can do at the MCP layer). Tests: `internal/store/sqlite_test.go:TestSearchByText_VaultActiveErrors` (vault-on returns the encryption error) and `internal/mcp/tools_test.go:TestSageRecall_VaultActiveForcesSemantic` + `TestSageRecall_RetriesSemanticOnVaultEncryptedFTSError` (mock `/v1/embed/info` to honestly report semantic, mock to lie and return the FTS error and verify retry) plus `api/rest/embed_handler_test.go:TestHandleEmbedInfo_VaultActiveForcesSemantic`. Boundary: `internal/store/postgres.go` is untouched (its "text search not available" error is documented as expected behavior), and the FTS5-vs-encryption architectural constraint is unchanged — we fixed routing/UX, not the indexing reality.
- **Org name lookup endpoint + SDK routing (6.6.9)** — `client.get_org("levelup")` previously 404'd because the Python SDK passed the human-readable name straight into `GET /v1/org/{org_id}`, which the REST handler treated as an opaque orgID. There was no name→orgID resolver anywhere in the stack, and `processOrgRegister` doesn't enforce name uniqueness — orgID is `sha256(adminID + ":" + name + ":" + height)` so two admins (or the same admin at different heights) can both register an org named "levelup" and land in distinct orgID slots. Fix: a one-to-many `org_name:<name>:<orgID>` reverse index in BadgerDB, maintained from `RegisterOrg` and backfilled idempotently from existing `org:*` forward entries on every `NewBadgerStore` open (so in-place upgrades work without a chain reset). New `GET /v1/org/by-name/{name}` returns `{"orgs": [...]}` — empty result is HTTP 200 (a valid answer), not 404. Python SDK `get_org(identifier)` now sniffs the input: 32-char lowercase hex routes to `/v1/org/{id}` unchanged; anything else hits the by-name endpoint and returns the single match, raising `SageAPIError(404)` for zero matches and `ValueError` for >1 matches so callers can disambiguate via `list_orgs_by_name`. **Known quirk surfaced by the new endpoint:** the same human-readable name can map to multiple orgIDs — this was already true in v6.6.8 but the SDK assumption hid it; we left `processOrgRegister` alone (name-uniqueness enforcement is a behavior change worth a separate discussion). Reported by the Level Up team on v6.6.8 validation. Tests: `internal/store/badger_multiorg_test.go` (empty, single, multi-admin, legacy backfill, store-open auto-backfill) + `api/rest/org_byname_test.go`.
- **`PUT /v1/agent/{id}/permission` no longer silently no-ops for non-admin callers (6.6.9)** — A non-prod-admin caller setting `visible_agents="*"` (or any other field) on `PUT /v1/agent/{id}/permission` previously got HTTP 200 with a real `tx_hash` while the SQL row stayed untouched. Two cascading defects: (1) the REST handler used `broadcast_tx_sync`, which only inspects CheckTx (signature/nonce) — the FinalizeBlock rejection (`code=67 "not an admin"`) was never propagated to the client, so the API confirmed success for a write the chain had refused; (2) the ABCI handler `processAgentSetPermission` hard-gated on the on-chain global `Role=="admin"`, meaning ONLY the original deployment-admin identity could ever land a permission write — so the most common deployment pattern (an agent declaring its own RBAC surface, or an org admin configuring a member) silently returned 200 + empty SQL. Reported by the Level Up team while validating v6.6.8. Fix: REST does a fail-fast pre-flight RBAC check using BadgerDB (`callerCanSetPermission`) and switches to `broadcast_tx_commit` so any consensus-side rejection still surfaces (`broadcastErrorStatus` maps "access denied" to HTTP 403); ABCI auth model widens to *self-set* OR *global admin* OR *org admin of any org the target also belongs to* (using the `agent_orgs` index from v6.6.8 + `GetMemberClearance` for role lookup). The auth model lives in code comments at both `api/rest/agent_handler.go:handleAgentSetPermission` and `internal/abci/app.go:processAgentSetPermission` so the two layers can't drift. Regression tests in `api/rest/permission_handler_test.go` cover self-set, org-admin, global-admin, unauthorized-403 (no broadcast, no tx_hash), and FinalizeBlock-rejection-surfaces-as-403; `internal/abci/app_test.go` adds matching ABCI-level coverage.
- **Multi-org membership no longer silently strips access (6.6.8)** — `BadgerStore.AddOrgMember` previously maintained an `agent_org:<agentID>` *single-slot* reverse lookup that every new add overwrote. The forward `org_member:` entries (clearance, role, height) for prior orgs survived, but `HasAccessMultiOrg` and `agentHasTopSecretClearance` only consulted the single slot — so the moment a pipeline agent was added to a second org, queries scoped against the first org's domains returned HTTP 200 with zero memories despite the agent still being a `clearance=4` member there. Reported by the Level Up agent (4 pipeline agents added to a new tenant org disappeared from prod-org recall). Fix: a one-to-many `agent_orgs:<agentID>:<orgID>` reverse index, additive on every add and surgically removed on `RemoveOrgMember` (legacy single slot rebound deterministically to the lexically smallest remaining org so federation governance auto-pickers don't break). `HasAccessMultiOrg` now iterates every org the agent belongs to and every org the domain owner belongs to, granting same-org clearance against any matching pair and falling back to a federation check across the cartesian product. `agentHasTopSecretClearance` returns true if TS in *any* org. Federation `propose`/`approve`/`revoke` ABCI handlers verify membership of the *specified* org (`IsAgentInOrg`) instead of comparing against the legacy primary slot, so multi-org admins can act on either side of a federation. `NewBadgerStore` runs an idempotent backfill from the authoritative `org_member:` forward index, so in-place upgrades from pre-v6.6.8 schemas work without a chain reset. Regression tests in `internal/store/badger_multiorg_test.go`.
- **Encrypted CA private key in quorum manifest (6.6.6/6.6.7)** — `sage-gui quorum-init` previously embedded the quorum CA private key as plaintext PEM inside `quorum-manifest.json`. Anyone who got the file (misdelivered email, Slack drop, shared backup) had the CA forever and could mint valid TLS certs for the quorum. Now: the CA key is wrapped with an Argon2id + AES-256-GCM envelope (`internal/tlsca/manifest_crypt.go`) keyed by an operator passphrase set via `SAGE_QUORUM_PASSPHRASE` env var or interactive prompt. Share the passphrase OUT-OF-BAND (different channel from the manifest file). `quorum-join` prompts for it on import; tampered envelopes (flipped salt/nonce/ciphertext bytes) fail closed via authenticated encryption. Pre-encryption manifests with plaintext `ca_key` are rejected outright with a regen prompt. v6.6.7 = v6.6.6 + golangci-lint shadow fixes that blocked the v6.6.6 release workflow.

<details>
<summary>Full v6.6.x changelog</summary>

- v6.6.10: `sage_recall` UX fix on vault-encrypted nodes — `/v1/embed/info` forces `semantic=true` when the store reports `VaultActive()`; MCP `toolRecall` adds a belt-and-braces retry that re-runs the semantic path when the FTS5 path returns the vault-encrypted marker; cleaner SQLite error wording.
- v6.6.9: Org name lookup (`GET /v1/org/by-name/{name}` + SDK hex-vs-name routing) AND `PUT /v1/agent/{id}/permission` silent-failure fix (REST pre-flight RBAC + `broadcast_tx_commit`; ABCI auth widened to self-set / global-admin / org-admin)
- v6.6.8: Multi-org membership fix — `agent_orgs` one-to-many reverse index, `HasAccessMultiOrg` iterates, federation handlers gated by `IsAgentInOrg`
- v6.6.7: Encrypted CA key in quorum manifest (lint-fix re-cut of v6.6.6)
- v6.6.6: Encrypted CA key in quorum manifest (release blocked by lint; superseded by v6.6.7)
- v6.6.5: Python SDK version alignment (PyPI publish repair for v6.6.4)
- v6.6.4: SQLite pragma root-cause fix + writeMu-guarded BeginTx + post-commit background context + first-register on_chain_height
- v6.6.3: ABCI HEALTHCHECK + chain-bootstrap-window doc
- v6.6.2: Silent-filter observability + org-clearance-as-seeAll + admin bootstrap docs
- v6.6.1: Offchain SQLITE_BUSY silent-drop fix (correctness; flush-before-badger reorder)
- v6.6.0: Tags on propose/query + `/v1/agent/register` response field rename to `on_chain_height`

### v6.5 Highlights

- **Encrypted Node-to-Node Communication (6.5.0)** — REST API TLS support for quorum mode. Per-quorum ECDSA P-256 certificate authority, auto-generated during `quorum-init`/`quorum-join`. Dual-listener pattern: TLS on `:8443` for network traffic, plain HTTP on `localhost:8080` for dashboard/MCP.
- **CometBFT P2P Already Encrypted (6.5.0)** — Verified that CometBFT v0.38.15 encrypts all validator-to-validator gossip via SecretConnection (X25519 DH + ChaCha20-Poly1305). No plaintext memories on the wire.
- **TLS Certificate Infrastructure (6.5.0)** — New `internal/tlsca/` package: CA generation, node cert generation, PEM I/O, TLS config builders. `sage-gui cert-status` CLI for expiry monitoring. Python SDK v6.1.0 adds `ca_cert` parameter.
- **Stuck-proposed deprecation + vote dedup (6.5.1)** — When all validators voted but quorum (2/3) wasn't reached (e.g. 2-2 tie), memories stayed in `proposed` forever and the validator ticker re-voted every 2 seconds (~1.4M redundant txs over 8 days for one stuck memory). Now: deprecate the memory when votes are in but quorum is missed, and track per-session voted memories to prevent re-vote.
- **`/v1/memory/{id}/forget` + SDK `forget()` (6.5.4)** — Closes a semantic gap where "forget" was the user-facing verb across MCP/dashboard/docs but only `/challenge` existed. New endpoint is a thin alias for challenge with an optional reason (defaults to "deprecated by user" — `challenge` requires a non-empty reason, `forget` is forgiving for dedup callers).
- **RBAC ownership theft fix + real broadcast errors (6.5.5)** — Two bugs masqueraded as generic "Failed to broadcast" errors when CometBFT was fine and FinalizeBlock was returning "access denied". Fix: reserve `general` and `self` as shared catch-all domains (never auto-registered), make `RegisterDomain` check-and-set instead of silent overwrite, add `TransferDomain` for explicit admin transfers, and surface the real broadcast error from REST handlers (403 on access-denied instead of generic 500).

<details>

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/l33tdawg/sage.git && cd sage
go build -o sage-gui ./cmd/sage-gui/
./sage-gui setup    # Pick your AI, get MCP config
./sage-gui serve    # SAGE + Dashboard on :8080
```

Or grab a binary: [macOS DMG](https://github.com/l33tdawg/sage/releases/latest) (signed & notarized) | [Windows EXE](https://github.com/l33tdawg/sage/releases/latest) | [Linux tar.gz](https://github.com/l33tdawg/sage/releases/latest)

### Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/l33tdawg/sage:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ~/.sage:/root/.sage ghcr.io/l33tdawg/sage:latest
```

Pin a specific version with `ghcr.io/l33tdawg/sage:6.0.0`.

### Upgrading from an older version?

If you installed SAGE before v5.0 and your AI isn't doing turn-by-turn memory updates, re-run the installer in your project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
sage-gui mcp install
```

This installs Claude Code hooks that enforce the memory lifecycle (boot, turn, reflect) — even if your `.mcp.json` is already configured. Restart your Claude Code session after running this.
