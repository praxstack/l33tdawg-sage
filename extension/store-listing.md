SAGE Memory for AI

## Short Description (132 chars max for Chrome)
Give your AI a secure, permanent memory. Works with ChatGPT, and more — even on free plans.

## Full Description

Every time you close an AI conversation, it forgets everything. (S)AGE fixes that — securely.

This extension connects your AI's web interface to (S)AGE, an open-source memory system that runs entirely on your computer. Your AI remembers your projects, preferences, and lessons learned across every conversation.

- Works on free plans — no paid tier required
- 10 memory tools: remember, recall, reflect, and more
- Sidebar panel with memory stats and quick actions
- Open source, Apache 2.0 licensed

Currently supports ChatGPT (chat.openai.com). More providers coming soon.
Requires (S)AGE running locally. Download free at https://l33tdawg.github.io/sage/
