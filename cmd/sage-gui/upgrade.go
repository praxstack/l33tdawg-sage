// Package main — `sage-gui upgrade` operator surface.
//
// This is the missing operator-submit half of the app-version upgrade
// machinery (issue #32). The voting and processing halves already exist:
// processUpgradePropose (internal/abci/app.go) persists and deterministically
// activates a plan, and the validator auto-voter (node.go) re-votes ACCEPT on
// any active upgrade proposal whose target this binary supports. But nothing in
// the tree could *submit* a plan for app-v7…app-v10: the watchdog
// (upgrade_watchdog.go) is frozen at the deployment-safe default and is the only
// other TxTypeUpgradePropose constructor. Without this surface the
// governance-gated forks — app-v7 (content-validation), app-v8 (quorum-gated
// upgrades), app-v9 (nonce/replay), app-v10 (corroboration integrity, #31) —
// are unreachable on a deployed chain.
//
// The command reuses the watchdog's exact signing/broadcast path
// (buildUpgradeProposeTx → EncodeTx → broadcastTxSync, signed with the
// operator's ~/.sage/agent.key) and adds the guards an operator action needs:
// strictly-sequential targets (current+1 only) and a canonical plan name.

Activate the governance-gated app-version consensus forks (app-v7…app-v%d).
Forks activate strictly ONE AT A TIME — each propose must target the chain's
current version + 1, so an existing chain walks the ladder with repeated
status/propose rounds until status reports app-v%d.
The voting/processing already exists; this submits the plan an operator needs.

Subcommands:
  status                       Show the chain's app version and the next fork
  propose --target <N>         Propose activation of app-v<N> (must be current+1)

propose flags:
  --target <N>      App version to activate. MUST be the chain's current version + 1.
                    Forks activate one at a time; jumping (e.g. 6 -> 10) would turn on
                    only app-v10 and permanently strand the skipped forks.
  --name <s>        Optional. Defaults to the canonical "app-v<target>" (which is
                    required); a non-canonical name is rejected.
  --agent-key <p>   Sign the proposal with this key instead of $SAGE_HOME/agent.key.
                    Accepts an agent.key seed or a CometBFT priv_validator_key.json.
                    Use past app-v8 when the chain-admin identity isn't your default
                    agent.key (issue #34).
  --rpc <url>       CometBFT RPC endpoint (default: $SAGE_COMET_RPC or
                    http://127.0.0.1:26657).
  --yes             Skip the confirmation prompt.

The proposal is signed with $SAGE_HOME/agent.key (or the --agent-key file) and routed
through the 2/3 governance quorum; validators auto-vote ACCEPT if they support the
target. Run this on the node host where the key lives.

Past app-v8 the proposer must be a chain-admin agent: the signing key's agent ID must
hold Role==admin in the on-chain registry. On a standard node that is usually your
operator agent.key — once it has been used for any admin op, which is what materializes
the role on chain; on some deployments it is the genesis validator key (pass it with
--agent-key). If BOTH keys are rejected with code 47, the admin role isn't materialized
on chain yet: run any admin op (e.g. a set-permission) with that key first, then retry.
